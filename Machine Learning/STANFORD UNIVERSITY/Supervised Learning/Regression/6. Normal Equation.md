## Normal Equation
Gradient descent gives one way of minimizing J. Let’s discuss a second way of doing so, this time performing the minimization explicitly and without resorting to an iterative algorithm. In the "Normal Equation" method, we will minimize J by explicitly taking its derivatives with respect to the θj ’s, and setting them to zero. This allows us to find the optimum theta without iteration. The normal equation formula is given below: <br>

There is **no need** to do feature scaling with the normal equation.<br>
The following is a comparison of gradient descent and the normal equation:
